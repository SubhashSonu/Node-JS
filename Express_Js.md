# 📦 Why Use Express.js and How It Is Useful

## 🧠 Why Use Express.js?

### 1. Node.js Alone Is Low-Level
- Node.js provides basic HTTP functionality using the `http` module.
- Handling routing, middleware, and response formatting becomes **tedious** in raw Node.js.

💡 **Express.js** simplifies and abstracts this complexity.

## 🛠️ What Express.js Helps With

### 1. Routing Made Simple

```js
app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
  res.send("About Page");
});
```
Define routes easily without manually checking `req.method` or `req.url`.

### 2. Middleware Support
Middleware functions run before the final request handler.

Use cases:
- Authentication
- Logging
- Parsing request bodies

```js
app.use(express.json()); // Parses incoming JSON requests
```

### 3. Simplified Request and Response Handling
Useful helpers:
- `res.send()` – send text/html
- `res.json()` – send JSON response
- `req.params` – access route parameters
- `req.query` – access query string values

### 4. Easier Error Handling
Use centralized error-handling middleware to catch and handle errors gracefully.

### 5. Template Engine Integration
Render dynamic HTML with template engines like EJS or Pug.

```js
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
```

### 6. Scalability and Modularity
Organize code using MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.

Easier to manage and scale in larger apps.
